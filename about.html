                FBJ is a german Recording Artist who infiltrates the local Hip Hop scene with his new songs. Musically he does not stay in one particular lane like many other Rappers do. He has a wide range of different styles which he uses to shape his own unique sound. His love for music in general but especially for rap music is the foundation of his career and led him to try rapping himself. Starting off in his hometown Magdeburg he began to release some of his first tracks in the summer of 2016. He created his first two projects together with the legendary beat maker and producer “beatsbycryptic” which have been launched in December 2016 and April 2017.

                After that he took some time to bring his skills to the next level and he closed the year with a few free tracks. 2018 has been a turning point for the young artist because he finally stepped out of his comfort zone to try new sounds and experiment with his singing voice. After he discovered and built his new abilities he never stopped working on new music and his catalogue is growing every day. Inspired by the greatest of all time and the new age sound based in the south of America he continues to bless the world with new tunes although most of his songs are not available online. His latest projects represent his new style and give a hint of the potential that he has.
